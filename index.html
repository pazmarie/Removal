				<p><font size="2" color="white">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHello! My name is Paz Marie Aleria, 18yrs of age. currently residence of Barangay San Roque, maribojoc, Bohol. I'm studying in Cristal e-College, Tagbilaran Campus. formerly a 2nd year college taking up Bachelor Science of in Information Technology. I have 1 brother and 1 sister. My brother is in grade 9 while my sister is in grade 5. Our moter is a house-keeper. Sometimes she helps in our Auntie's Store. As of our father, he died because of motorcycle accident, we didn't expect that it will happened to him. But God has only the power to do everything and we have nothing to do with it. God knows. Until now we're still not yet coping and stil in the stage of recovering of what happened because it's not that easy to accept it. As I've said, God knows. I missed him that much! My favorite. My favorites doing stuffs are reading wattpad stories, writing diary, watching korean movies. But what I like the most is I'm talking to myself sometimes and the Language that I used is Hangeul/Korean. Sounds weird. But I'm not crazy person, I just like to talk Korean. Beacause I have no guts to talk to other people in that kind of language. Status?? I'm in a relationship now with the man I love the most. The man that I truely loved. I'm happy being with him. Being inloved with him.<br> So, as for me I'm happy whenever I'm with mama, inday, epoy and etan. Happiness is something that you'll feel it. It doesn't come with any warning. You just feel it. Minsan nga malalaman mo lang na happy ka na kapag tapos na. kapag nangyari na. You're too busy enjoying the moment kaya you don't pay much attention to your feelings. ^_^<br><br> MOTTO: In order to succeed, your desire for success should be greater than your fear of failure...<center> Thank you!</center></font>
