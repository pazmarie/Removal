I'm studying in Cristal e-College, Tagbilaran Campus. formerly a 2nd year college taking up Bachelor Science of in Information Technology. I have 1 brother and 1 sister. My brother is in grade 9 while my sister is in grade 5. Our moter is a house-keeper. Sometimes she helps in our Auntie's Store. As of our father, he died because of motorcycle accident, we didn't expect that it will happened to him. But God has only the power to do everything and we have nothing to do with it. God knows. Until now we're still not yet coping and stil in the stage of recovering of what happened because it's not that easy to accept it. As I've said, God knows. I missed him that much! My favorite' <br><br><center> Thank you!</center></font>
